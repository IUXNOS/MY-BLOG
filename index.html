        <p class="para">My hobby is reading boks of all genres in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and study 7th standard.  I know that reading is good habit which can help me in various parts of my life. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of entertainment, knowledge, and inspiration. It can help us be disciplined, loyal, and most importantly a successful person in our life.
